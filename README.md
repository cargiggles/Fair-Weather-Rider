# Fair Weather Rider

## Summary

Fair Weather Rider is a Python based script which calls the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to determine whether or not weather conditions are favorable enough for you to comfortably commute by bike, without being rained upon. If so, it will send a text message reminding you. This particular implementation leverages the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically, Lambda and SNS.
