# Fair Weather Rider

## Summary



Fair Weather Rider is a Python based script which calls the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to determine whether or not weather conditions are favorable enough for you to comfortably commute by bike, without being rained upon. If so, it will send a text message reminding you. This particular implementation leverages the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically, Lambda and SNS.
